# django_page
this is a copy of page made for Hudini, as a commercial one, but he decided to stop working on that right now, we will continue work in the near future

[hosted page here](http://www.bassmood.pl/)

I make many features in such a projeckt but we use around 4 in current state

## how to run project
in terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/KacperKotlewski/django_page
```
next you run files **```run.bat```** or **```run.sh```** depends of the system you use

after that in your browser enter on localhost:8000
